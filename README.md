## Frontend Information:

**Documentation:**

PantryBot frontend uses React, Vite, Bootstrap, React Router, React Hook Form, and React-Cookie.

Frontend uses React.

Vite is used to speed up development using React.

Bootstrap is for easy styling.

React-Cookie is used to create and get cookies.

**Styling Components:**

Use these pre-styled components to create our app in the frontend:

[React Bootstrap Components](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/components/accordion)

**Other Info:**

Most editing should be done in the src folder. The only time you will need to edit outside the src folder is when editing enviromental variables. Images should be placed in the assets folder and enviromental variables should be placed or edited in the .env file. The component folder is used for components that will be reused multiple times acorss the app. The constants folder is for constants that will be used across that app but will not change. The pages folder includes all our pages. The layouts folder contains layouts that are applied to multiple pages. When adding a page, make sure to add it to the router in main.jsx. The app.scss contains information about our theme, I don't think we will have to edit this file much as bootstrap already includes most of our styling. The only change I added to this file was overriding the bootstap primary color of blue to our primary color of green.
